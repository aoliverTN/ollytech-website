        OllyTech ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you visit
        <strong>ollytech.com</strong> (the "Site").
      </p>

      <h2>1. Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        OllyTech participates in affiliate marketing programs, including the
        <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program
        designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also participate in other affiliate programs including ShareASale, ClickBank, and similar networks.
        When you click an affiliate link on our site and make a qualifying purchase, we may earn a small commission
        at no additional cost to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content or recommendations. We only recommend
        products we genuinely believe provide value.
      </p>
      <p>
        In accordance with the <strong>FTC's guidelines</strong>, all affiliate links and sponsored content
        on this site are clearly disclosed at the point of recommendation.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We do not collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., via email contact).
      We may collect the following non-personal information automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on each page</li>
        <li>Referring website or search engine</li>
        <li>General geographic location (country/region level)</li>
        <li>Device type (desktop, mobile, tablet)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information is collected in aggregate and is not linked to individual users.</p>

      <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        OllyTech may use cookies — small text files stored on your device — to improve site performance
        and analyze traffic patterns. Cookies used on this site may include:

        when you click an affiliate link, to attribute purchases and calculate commissions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect the functionality
        of some features but will not prevent you from using the site.
      </p>
