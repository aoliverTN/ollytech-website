          <h2>Hi, I'm Olly.</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            IT professional by day, health &amp; wellness enthusiast and gadget researcher by night.
            I started OllyTech because I got tired of spending money on products that looked great
            in reviews but didn't deliver in real life.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
      <p>
        Between my work in IT and my personal interest in health, I spend a lot of time researching
        products — supplements, fitness gear, tech accessories, smart home devices. Over the years
        I've found a handful of genuinely excellent products and a whole lot of overpriced ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        OllyTech is where I share what I've learned. Every recommendation on this site went through
        real research — reading studies, comparing specs, checking third-party certifications, and
        cutting through the marketing language to find what actually performs.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Cover</h2>
      <div class="about-niches">
        <div class="niche-block niche-health">
          <div class="niche-icon">🌿</div>
          <h3>Health &amp; Wellness</h3>
          <p>
            Supplements (with a focus on evidence-based ingredients), fitness equipment,
            recovery tools, sleep aids, and everyday wellness products. I'm not a doctor —
            I always recommend consulting one — but I research what the science actually says
            about the products I feature.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="niche-block niche-tech">
          <div class="niche-icon">⚡</div>
          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>
            Practical tech that solves real problems: home networking, productivity tools,
            audio gear, smart home devices, and work-from-home essentials. With a background
            in IT, I can dig into specs beyond the marketing bullet points.

      <h2>My Review Process</h2>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li><strong>Research first.</strong> I start with customer reviews, independent testing, and where applicable, published studies.</li>
        <li><strong>Real criteria.</strong> I evaluate value for money, build quality, ease of use, and long-term reliability — not just launch hype.</li>
        <li><strong>Honest pros and cons.</strong> Every recommendation includes what it doesn't do well, not just the upsides.</li>
        <li><strong>No paid placements.</strong> Brands cannot pay to be featured. My recommendations are not influenced by affiliate relationships.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        OllyTech participates in affiliate marketing programs, including the Amazon Associates Program
        and other affiliate networks. This means if you click a link and make a purchase, I may earn
        a small commission at no extra cost to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        These commissions help keep the site running and allow me to keep researching and writing.
        They do not influence which products I recommend — I only feature products I'd genuinely
        suggest to a friend. For full details, see my <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
